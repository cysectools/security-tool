"# security-tool" 

# This is my first published security tool. #
# This Program allows you to search a 'target's' open ports using the python-nmap library. #
# Then asks if you'd like to proceed on to the "Overload" program. #
# "Overload" program is a packet flooder program that will allow you to mask your ip address as well as flood your target's chosen port #

# This was inspired by a few youtube tutorials I watched a while ago. Will release credit once I find the videos again. #
# Feedback and updates are always appreciated! #
# Thanks for stopping by #
